# csv-to-png
Convert csv files to png files using canvas!

## Installation and Development
```bash
npm ci
npm run start:replace
npm run view
```
This will create an output file of the png data url (output/data-url.txt) and an output file for viewing the image in html using http-server. This command will launch the http-server on the output folder and by default show the index.html file with the replaced data-url. Once the previous commands are running, you can modify the solution and it will hot reload. The output folder will contian all png data.
